        Joseph Byerly born in Michigan in 1923. Grewing he was trying to get through the depression living in a house with grandparents
        that were direct immigrants  from Bavaria. Growing up with both German and English in his household. Still in high school when
        Pearl Harbor was attacked the very athletic Byerly turned  down a scholarship to play basketball at  Notre Dame and joined the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/101st_Airborne_Division">101st Airborne Division</a> were he got nicknamed Jumpin Joe. In training he specialized as a demolitions expert once he made it to
        England after training was complete he was selected for a few volunteer jumps. In May in April of 1944 where he covertly dropped
        into occupied France to deliver 250,000 dollars in gold to the French Resistance  as funding from the Allies. After making it back
        safe both times his first large-scale combat jump was with 101st airborne during <a href="https://hr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_D">Operation Overlord</a>.

        One of the biggest problems for the  paratroopers in this operation though was that because of all the anti-aircraft fire the planes dropping them off
        were going too fast and sometimes to slow and when they jumped  everybody got  scattered all across their drop zones far from where they are supposed to be. Joe had
        to jump out of his plane exceptionally low at about 400 feet and landed on top of the church at Saint count  Dumont and was able to slide down off the
        side to a cemetary and run off into the night under German fire. After this he was able to blow up a German power station and while walking towards
        his objective of two bridges that his unit was supposed to take. He crawled hedge rows into a German machine-gun nest and was promptly captured
        and thus begins one of the most amazing and  incredible POWs stories of the war. After he was captured his tags were taken and given to a German
        soldier who in an American uniform was going to attempt to mingle with American troops  but it failed resulting in American soldiers finding his
        tags and listing him as dead.

        After this first capture he was marched with other POWs to a holding area in Karen tan where he  received a minor wound from advancing
        Allied artillery. In the chaos though the prisoners got separated from their handlers and as the German patrol came back to collect
        the POWs he and a few  soldiers made a run for it and got away wandering the Normandy countryside for a few hours looking for friendly
        troops until they were recaptured again. He was then sent to saint-lo where he survived  another allied attack this time in bomber form
        before he was taken to a monastery and questioned heavily about his German heritage and why he was fighting  with the Americans. About
        the incident he  said.
        " <i>I was interrogated 20 to 24 hours a day they were trying to get all the usual questions answered why me as a German was I fighting for
        the Jews Roosevelt and Morgenthau against my own  people some time during the questioning I called a German officer an sob and woke up
        several days later in a hospital with a big headache and a bashed head and later I was taken back to the  monastery</i>". NAfter this he
        was put into a forced labour repairing railroad tracks around northern France having to dodge even more friendly bomber raids on a regular
        basis. After that he was taking eastward  through France ending up at a warehouse outside of Paris and eventually in Stalag 11a in Lindbergh
        Germany where he was finally able to write home surely to the surprise of his family who had been  told he was dead and was registered as a
        pow.

        After this he was was marched eastward towards Stalag 3 C being the person that he was though Joe was not able to sit out the rest of
         the  war and quickly tried to figure out ways to escape. His first escape attempt with two other POWs by the names of Breuer and Quinn
        was pulled off by bribing the German guards with cigarettes provided  to them by the Red Cross and boarding a train headed for Poland
        where they would meet up with either the Red Army or the Polish resistance. Their hopes were dashed quickly though  is when the train
        stopped they realized  they had bordered one headed for Berlin. They were soon found by the Gestapo where they were tortured and
        interrogated for the  next week it was decided that they were going to be shot as spies but before this happened the army reclaimed
        them as POWs once back in the hands of the German army. They were sent back to Stalag 3c however upon returning they heard on a contraband
        radio that they kept secret about how the  Soviets had smashed through Army Group centre and we're getting fairly close to the camp 
         where they were being kept really only a few days walking distance away so the trio attempted their escape again. This time sneaking
        out an empty food containers leaving the camp however on  the way out the cart or whatever they were on tipped over to where they
        had to make a run for it with only by berly  getting out alive heading towards the Russian lines after some walking he ran  into 
        a Russian tank unit where he identified himself as an American instead of asking to be taken to the rear and trying to head home
        after his long harrowing journey the mad lad asked if he could fight alongside them the first russian officer he asked promptly
        said no to his request but upon going to the battalion commander who was actually the rather  famous 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandra_Samusenko">Aleksandra Samusenko</a> the only female tank commander of the
        1st Guards tank army who became well known for her exploits at Kursk. His request was granted and he was able to fight  alongside them.

        Joe fought with them for about a month putting his demolitions expertise to good use and freed his previous POWs camp Stalag 3c in the process
        he was later wounded and taken into a Soviet field hospital. Where none other than field marshal <a href="https://hr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgij_%C5%BDukov">≈Ωukov</a> came to see him after hearing the strange
        story about an American fighting in his army  after telling his tale to Zhukov through an interpreter he was ordered back to Moscow to be taken
        home and given a piece of paper the following day by one of his officers who told him you  don't need to know what it says but it will get you
        where you need to go.

        He found was way back to the US embassy there were still a few more issues for him though as when he got to the US embassy  both the Americans
        and Soviets were suspicious of him because according to their records Joe Byerly was dead since his tags had been found in Normandy and  he was kept
        under guard until his fingerprints were able to be used to verify his identity out of fear of him being a spy or something. Joe returned  home in 
        April of 1945 and was able to spend VE day with his family when he came home he found that because they figured he was dead there had been a full 
        service for him in the town's Church. He would later get married by the very same priest who did his wake in the very same church that his funeral
        was in. Joe remained active in veterans organizations throughout his life and  was recognized by both President Clinton and President Yeltsin in 
        1944 at the 50th anniversary of the D-day landings.
